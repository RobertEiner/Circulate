# Circulate (work in progress)

Circulate is a concept for a website where people can buy and sell second hand items.

## why?
In today's world we are consuming more than we can afford, using natural resources like never before. A circular mindset, where, instead of buying new things, the focus is on finding a new use for the things that we no longer need.

# How?
Users will post items that they no longer need, and let other users buy them. It will also be possible to give items away for free.
